## Schedule

### Session 01 - 01/23/18 - Overview / Installation / openFrameworks basics

This session will introduce the course, what algorithmic sound practice entails, and then introduce you to openFrameworks, a creative-coding toolkit written primarily in C++.  It brings together many frameworks for a cross-platform coding environment capable of real-time audio visual analysis, graphics, sound processing, 3D, multithreading, communication protocols, and plenty more.  In this session, we'll see how to navigate openFrameworks, build a project, compile existing examples, and find additional resources.

### Session 02 - 01/30/18 - Basic Graphics / Audio Recording

In the next two sessions, we'll explore the use of some basic audio and graphics primitives.  We'll see how to animate lines, and use them to control the recording and playback of audio.  The end result will be a sampler that can record/playback audio, automatically segment audio, and apply some simple filters such as windowing.  Along the way we'll learn about a lot of basic coding principles including if statements, for loops, and how to use classes to build objects and abstract our code.  We'll also see how to use parameters to define elements in a graphical user interface.

### Session 03 - 02/06/18 - Audio Interaction

We'll continue with developing a sampler that can record and playback audio.  The approach we take to develop our sampler will allow us to scale it arbitrarily, as well as add new functionality to it fairly easily.  We'll then explore another application which can chop audio automatically and we'll see how this can be used to create an infinitely generating track.  To do this, we'll first see how to use the RMS of an audio signal to automatically segment audio.  Then we'll use some basic statistics of the RMS to segment audio and create some randomized audio playback of audio "grains", and also see how to visualize them.

### Session 04 - 02/13/18 - Overflow + Project Week

In case there is any material we needed more time for + use class time with the TA to develop your first project.

### Session 05 - 02/20/18 - First Project Presentations + Maximilian AM/FM, Sample Loading, and Granular Synthesis

This session covers maximilian, a c++ library for audio synthesis.  We look at oscillators, AM, FM, delay lines, filters, also two methods for loading samples, maxiSample and pkmEXTAudio methods for reading and saving any audio format using Apples EXTAudio format.  Finally, we look at how to use maximilian's granular synthesis engine to independently pitch and time stretch the amen break.

### Session 06 - 02/27/18 - Advanced Audio and Visual Analysis

We'll cover basic computer graphics including virtual cameras, meshes, shaders, and frame buffers. We'll then see how to do some computer vision such as understanding colorspaces, frame differencing, and optical flow, and show how to build a mesh that uses optical flow to distort it. We'll then look at the DFT, Mel Transform, and MFCCs for audio fingerprinting and analysis.

### Session 07 - 03/06/18 - Overflow + Project Week

Use class time with the TA to develop your first project.

### Session 08 - 03/13/18 - Second Project Presentations + Machine Learning Part I

We will explore the use of kNN and tSNE for concatenative synthesis and visual exploration of a grain cloud.

### Session 09 - 03/20/18 - Machine Learning Part II

We'll explore the use of k-means clustering and markov chains for generative concatenative synthesis.
 

### Session 10 - 03/27/18 - Sprint Break

### Session 11 - 04/03/18 - Ambisonics, Binaural, and 3D Sound

HRTF and binaural audio synthesis, iOS ARKit and tracking, 3D sound.

### Session 12 - 04/10/18 - Overflow + Project Week

### Session 13 - 04/17/18 - Final Project Presentations

### Session 14 - 04/24/18 - Extra Material

### Session 15 - 05/01/18 - Extra Material


## Grading

* 25 percent for homeworks
* 50 percent for 3 projects
* 25 percent for attendance

## Website

* Make sure you have enrolled on learn.calarts.edu
* Use this github and learn.calarts.edu to find up to date homework information

## Expo

Students are encouraged to develop their final projects further into exhibits for the Digital Arts Expo.  For this reason, we will not ask students to be assessed on any material past 4/20, and final project presentations will be on 4/17 instead.  This will give you a few weeks to refine your work into an exhibit worthy project and ensure there is less overlap on demands for final projects along with the pressure of the expo.
